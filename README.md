An interactive dashboard is built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

JSON data is read in and visualized using the following libraries:
- D3
- Plotly
